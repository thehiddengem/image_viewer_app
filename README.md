We are using the following api to fetch images from the internet: https://picsum.photos/

After fetching the image we populate a Card with the image author's name and the image under the title. Look below for card UI references.

We want to populate the screen with a horizontally scrolling list of these image cards. Look below for UI references.
We want to be able to scroll to new images seamlessly and scroll back, up to 20 previous images.

### When Finished
When you have completed the assessment, email molly@ascentitech.com with the link to your new repository and answer the following questions as honestly as you can.

### Final Questions
1) How long did the assessment take to complete? Was there any task that took significantly longer than the others, and if so why?
2) Were there any tasks that you initially did not know how to complete? And if so, how did you approach them and take the steps to learn how to complete them? (It's okay if the answer is yes! Everyone learns on the job at some point)
3) Was this assessment feasible for the time given and relatively easy to follow? Any points of feedback?


#### Bonus
If you have some extra time and would like to really impress, you should add a likes feature. This means adding a like icon button the the cards and favorites page that shows all the previously liked images!
